	<h2>Lillian Aria Peterson</h2>
	<h2>Lily</h2>
	<p>Here's a little about me. First off, I want to learn more about computers so that I can make them better. I have ideas, but I don't know how to bring them to life just yet. That's why I want to learn.</p>
	<p>Second: when I'm not at work or studying, I love stories. I love reading, watching movies and TV shows(<i>Moon Knight</i> is awesome, by the way), and I am a bit of a theatre buff. I love going to the Utah Shakespeare Festival with my family when I get the chance.</p>
	<p>Lastly, I have been a member of the church my whole life. One of my favorite stories comes from the Bible. It's about Esther. She had guts to do what she did.</p>
