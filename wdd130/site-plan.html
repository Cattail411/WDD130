      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi! I’m Lily Peterson. I’m a website designer and I have a brilliant idea. Are you looking for a unique idea for an amazing new story? Lots of ideas can be found on social media these days, but they’re always so hard to find because they are bogged down by other irrelevant posts. My website uses an algorithm that finds those big ideas and puts them on the site. Not only that, this website also gives you the chance to communicate with the creators of said ideas. You can talk with them about their ideas and see what you can do to bring them to life. I call it Story-pitch.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience will be anyone who, like me, expresses interest in sharing ideas. These audience members
        will either be people with ideas of their own they want to share or they will be people looking for great ideas and want to know more about them.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
